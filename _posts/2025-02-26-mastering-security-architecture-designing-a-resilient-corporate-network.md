# Mastering Security Architecture: Designing a Resilient Corporate Network
*Published: February 26, 2025*

## Introduction

In my journey through my MSc in Cyber Security Engineering, one of the most fascinating modules I encountered was **Security Architecture and Network Defense**. This wasn‚Äôt just about understanding network diagrams or configuring VLANs; it was about designing a **resilient, scalable, and secure network** that could withstand evolving cyber threats. 

For my assignment, I built an internal network for a **200-employee tech company** with **five departments** and secured **VPN access** for remote workers. The challenge? Balancing security, performance, and real-world constraints using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. Let‚Äôs break down the experience and why it matters for organizations‚Äîand potential employers looking for a **Cloud Security Engineer** who knows their way around robust architectures.

## Designing a Secure Network: The Challenge

The fictional company, *Quantum Byte Dynamics*, had to ensure **seamless connectivity, high availability, and ironclad security** across its departments: **Sales, R&D, Administration, and Server Management**, with remote access for authorized personnel.

### Key Constraints:
- **Budget Limitations:** No high-end, enterprise-grade hardware
- **Security Priorities:** Prevent unauthorized access, secure remote work
- **Scalability:** Network design must support future expansion
- **Tool Limitations:** Cisco Packet Tracer, while useful for simulation, restricted many real-world optimizations such as dynamic routing protocols, advanced firewall configurations, and integration with cloud-based security solutions.

I tackled these challenges by implementing:
- **VLAN segmentation** to restrict inter-department access
- **Layer 3 switching** for efficient routing
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to limit exposure of sensitive data
- **AAA authentication (RADIUS)** for remote and Wi-Fi access
- **VPN for remote workers** to securely connect to internal resources

## Network Architecture: A Peek Under the Hood

### üìç **VLAN Segmentation**
Dividing the network into VLANs ensured departments only had access to what they needed:
- **VLAN 10 - Sales:** Customer interaction tools, restricted access
- **VLAN 20 - R&D:** High-performance computing, access to internal dev tools
- **VLAN 30 - Admin:** Access to all configurations, financial records
- **VLAN 40 - Servers:** Hosting DNS, DHCP, VPN, and internal web services

This setup enforced **Zero Trust principles**, ensuring that even within the company, users couldn‚Äôt access areas they weren‚Äôt authorized to.

### üîí **Security Measures: Keeping Threats at Bay**

Security is **never an afterthought**‚Äîhere‚Äôs what I implemented to protect the network:

1. **ACLs for Inter-VLAN Restrictions**  
   - Prevented lateral movement between departments  
   - Allowed only essential traffic (e.g., HTTPS but not HTTP)

2. **Firewalls & Logging**  
   - Implemented ACL-based firewalls for traffic filtering  
   - SYSLOG to monitor network events and detect anomalies

3. **Remote Access via VPN**  
   - Configured **IPSec-based VPN** for secure remote work  
   - Used **AAA authentication** for identity verification  
   - Verified encrypted data transmission using `show crypto ipsec sa`

4. **Wi-Fi Security (WPA2-Enterprise)**  
   - Used **RADIUS authentication** to prevent unauthorized access  
   - Applied **MAC filtering** and adjusted SSID range to limit exposure

## Lessons Learned: Bridging Academia and Industry

1. **Scalability vs. Security:** Designing a network that balances **performance, budget, and security** is an art. A scalable **IP allocation strategy** using DHCP and VLANs ensured the network could grow without redesign.

2. **Defense in Depth:** Relying on just one security measure is never enough. Implementing **firewalls, ACLs, and authentication layers** created a multi-layered defense against both **internal and external threats**.

3. **Real-World Limitations:** Cisco Packet Tracer is great, but real networks require **enterprise-grade security solutions** like **SIEM, EDR, and cloud-based backups**. In a professional setting, I‚Äôd integrate **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Azure Sentinel (SIEM), and IAM policies** for added resilience.

## Additional Optimizations in a Cloud Environment (Azure)

Since cloud environments introduce new security challenges and require different approaches to network architecture, I have identified key optimizations necessary for an Azure-based implementation. Unlike traditional on-premise networks, cloud environments demand greater flexibility, automation, and advanced security policies to protect against evolving threats. A well-architected cloud network must support scalability, high availability, and compliance with security frameworks like **NIST, CIS, and ISO 27001**.

To ensure a robust security posture while leveraging cloud capabilities, the following optimizations should be considered in an Azure-based architecture:
- **Azure Virtual WAN & ExpressRoute:** For optimized and secure interconnectivity between on-prem and cloud resources, reducing latency and providing a private, dedicated connection instead of relying on the public internet. 
- **Azure Firewall & NSGs (Network Security Groups):** To implement more granular access control, ensuring that only legitimate traffic flows between services while blocking unauthorized access attempts. 
- **Azure VPN Gateway & Conditional Access Policies:** To secure remote access with identity-based restrictions, enabling access based on user roles, device health, and geographical location.
- **Azure Defender & Sentinel:** For enhanced monitoring, threat intelligence, and SIEM integration, allowing proactive threat detection, automated responses, and compliance enforcement.
- **Zero Trust Model with Azure AD & Conditional Access:** Ensuring users and devices are authenticated before granting access to critical resources, implementing least privilege access principles, and leveraging multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Final Thoughts: How This Shapes My Career

This project wasn‚Äôt just an assignment‚Äîit was an opportunity to **apply security best practices in a practical scenario**. It sharpened my skills in **network defense, security architecture, and cloud security**, aligning with my aspirations in Cyber Security.
