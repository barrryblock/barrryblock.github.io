# Securing Smart Meters: Lessons from Cyber-Physical Systems

When I embarked on my MSc in Cyber Security Engineering, I didnâ€™t expect to find myself knee-deep in smart meters, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), and operational technology (OT) security. But here we areâ€”one coursework and countless security assessments later, I developed a framework to secure AMI networks and smart meters from cyber threats. Hereâ€™s how it went down.

## AMI and Smart Meters: A Double-Edged Sword  
Smart meters and AMI networks are the backbone of modern utility infrastructure, offering real-time consumption monitoring, remote diagnostics, and automated billing. But like all great tech, they come with security risksâ€”spoofing, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks, to name a few. 

### The Security Challenges  
I dissected AMIâ€™s security risks using the **STRIDE** threat modeling framework:
- **Spoofing**: Fake smart meters injecting false data
- **Tampering**: Physical attacks to alter readings
- **Repudiation**: Lack of audit trails for device actions
- **Information Disclosure**: Unencrypted transmissions revealing usage data
- **Denial of Service**: Flooding attacks disrupting network operations
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Weak authentication enabling unauthorized access

ðŸ‘‰ **Lesson learned:** AMI networks need **layered security**â€”from device hardening to network segmentation.

## Architecting Security: Network Segmentation & Firewalls  
One major win from my coursework was designing a **secure AMI network architecture**. Key strategies:

- **Segmentation**: Isolating smart meters, data concentrators, and head-end systems to limit attack spread.
- **Firewalls**: Configuring filters at data concentrators and head-end systems.
- **Encryption**: Securing data in transit with AES-256 and TLS.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensuring the right people access the right systems.

ðŸ‘‰ **Lesson learned:** A flat network is a hackerâ€™s paradiseâ€”**segmentation is king.**

## Intrusion Detection & Response: Snort to the Rescue  
To detect anomalies, I implemented **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** using Snort. One Snort rule I wrote monitored for excessive connection attempts on MQTT (a common AMI protocol):

```snort
alert tcp any any -> $MQTT_BROKER_IP 1883 \
(msg:"MQTT Excessive Connection Attempts"; flow:to_server,established; \
threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 10, seconds 60; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```
ðŸ‘‰ **Lesson learned:** **Detect early, respond faster.** IDS combined with a solid Incident Response Plan (IRP) is a game-changer.

## Cloud Security Considerations  
Modern AMI systems leverage cloud computing for scalability. That means: 
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** for secure API interactions
- **SIEM integration** for centralized monitoring
- **Data anonymization** to protect customer privacy

ðŸ‘‰ **Lesson learned:** Security doesnâ€™t stop at the networkâ€”**cloud security is crucial**.

## Final Thoughts  
This coursework wasnâ€™t just an assignmentâ€”it was a deep dive into **Operational Technology (OT) security** and how critical infrastructure needs robust defense mechanisms. The next time you see a smart meter, remember: itâ€™s more than just a digital power counter; itâ€™s a cybersecurity battleground.
