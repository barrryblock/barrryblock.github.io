## Professional Journey
My journey at CGI involved projects that stretched from automating intricate data migrations to managing unified endpoint systems. One particularly memorable project involved crafting PowerShell scripts to gather software usage data across thousands of endpoints; a task that vividly demonstrated the epic scope of enterprise oversight and highlighted the critical responsibility we hold in protecting user privacy.

My initiation into cybersecurity was humorous: in my first year at CGI, I eagerly spun up an Azure VM with a public IP, only to find it immediately bombarded by an army of dictionary attacks. While slightly alarming at the moment, this experience wasn't just a wake-up call; it sparked my lasting fascination with threat detection and the art (and science) of cyber defence.

Alongside this hands-on experience, my academic journey unfolded with equal enthusiasm. Originally from Nepal, I pursued my undergraduate studies at one of India’s premier engineering institutes, diving deep into foundational computing concepts. My projects included training CNNs to classify waste, essentially teaching machines how to recycle better [^1], and experimenting with LSTM and RNN models to power advanced reverse image searches [^2]. Determined to further specialize, I took my passion for security to the next level by enrolling in a Master’s program at the University of Warwick.

At Warwick, my studies ventured into the intriguing worlds of Digital Forensics, Cyber Security for Virtualisation Systems, Enterprise Cyber Security, and Cryptosystems. Each topic deepened my commitment to protecting data within increasingly intricate IT landscapes. My thesis, "Privacy Enhancing Technologies in Zero Trust Networks," tackled the delicate balance of robust security protocols and privacy preservation, employing Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to achieve the best of both worlds [^3].

Currently, as a Research Assistant at Warwick, I’m collaborating with both the University and the Alan Turing Institute on implementing OpenCTI, a cutting-edge cyber threat intelligence platform. This initiative dramatically improves how organizations collect, correlate, and respond to threat intelligence, empowering proactive security measures in a digital world that's never short on surprises. Whether through research, innovative development, or practical applications, my mission remains unwavering: to make impactful contributions to cybersecurity that effectively shield enterprises, and the people behind them, from evolving digital threats.
