## Professional Journey
During my tenure at CGI, I had the opportunity to engage with a diverse range of projects, from automating data migrations to supporting unified endpoint management. One initiative involved using PowerShell scripts to gather software usage information across thousands of endpoints—an experience that underscored both the immense power of enterprise-wide oversight and the corresponding responsibility to safeguard user privacy. In my very first year at CGI, I spun up an Azure VM with a public IP, only to discover it under immediate siege by a relentless dictionary attack. This unexpected incident not only introduced me to the urgency of cybersecurity challenges but also served as the catalyst for my ongoing fascination with threat detection and mitigation.  

Alongside my professional growth, I pursued my academic interests with the same level of curiosity and drive. Originally from Nepal, I completed my undergraduate degree at one of India’s top engineering institutes, where I delved into core Computing concepts. My projects ranged from developing a CNN-based waste classification system[^1] to experimenting with reverse image search algorithms using LSTM and RNN[^2]. Building on these foundations, I decided to elevate my understanding of security by enrolling in a Master’s program at the University of Warwick. This has allowed me to explore a variety of specialized topics, including _Digital Forensics_, _Cyber Security for Virtualisation Systems_, _Enterprise Cyber Security_ and _Crypto-systems and Data Protection_, each further sharpening my perspective on safeguarding data in increasingly complex IT ecosystems.

My thesis focused on “Privacy Enhancing Technologies in Zero Trust Networks.” The aim was to balance strong security protocols with privacy-centric frameworks, ensuring minimal intrusion into individual data while maintaining robust defense systems by the usage of Trusted Execution Environment(TEE)[^3]. Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant at Warwick, where I am collaborating with Warwick and the Alan Turing Institute on the implementation of OpenCTI, an advanced cyber threat intelligence platform. This initiative streamlines how organizations gather, correlate, and act on threat information, enabling proactive mitigation strategies in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Whether through research, development, or practical implementation, my goal remains consistent: to contribute meaningfully to cybersecurity advancements that protect both enterprises and end users alike.
