## Introduction
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is a critical component of modern cybersecurity strategies. It involves **collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information** about potential and existing threats to help organizations proactively defend against cyber attacks.

## Why is CTI Important?
- **Early threat detection**: Identifies vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
- **Improved security posture**: Helps in mitigating risks efficiently.
- **Incident response enhancement**: Provides actionable intelligence for rapid response.
- **Strategic decision-making**: Enables organizations to allocate resources effectively.

## Key CTI Frameworks & Tools
### **1. MITRE ATT&CK**
- A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques.
- Helps in mapping threats to known attack patterns.

### **2. OpenCTI**
- An open-source Cyber Threat Intelligence platform.
- Automates the ingestion, analysis, and sharing of threat data.

### **3. MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)**
- Facilitates sharing threat intelligence with the security community.
- Supports collaborative incident response efforts.

## Implementing CTI in Organizations
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Gather data from logs, threat feeds, and security tools.
2. **Threat Analysis** â€“ Correlate collected data with known threats.
3. **Integration with SIEM** â€“ Use **Microsoft Sentinel**, **Splunk**, or **Elastic Stack** for detection.
4. **Automated Response** â€“ Leverage playbooks and automation tools to respond to threats in real-time.

## Conclusion
Cyber Threat Intelligence is **not just a luxury but a necessity** in today's cyber landscape. Organizations must integrate CTI into their security operations to stay ahead of adversaries.
