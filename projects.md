# 🚀 **B.Tech Projects**

## 1️⃣ Waste Classification System using Convolutional Neural Networks  
📅 **April 2018**  
Developed an automated waste segregation system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system classifies waste into five categories: container, organic waste, metal, paper, and plastic. This project aimed to improve recycling efficiency and waste management by eliminating human intervention in waste sorting.

## 2️⃣ Content & Text-Based Image Retrieval and ERP Design Automation  
📅 **November 2018**  
Designed a system that retrieves images based on text descriptions using CNN and LSTM models. It also featured an ERP system for MNNIT, including seminar hall management, guest house management, and faculty intellectual property data management. The retrieval system used BLEU scores for similarity comparison.

## 3️⃣ Chatbot Implementation using Deep Natural Language Processing  
📅 **April 2019**  
Implemented a chatbot using a Seq2Seq model with an encoder-decoder RNN. The chatbot leverages NLP techniques such as tokenization, word embedding, and attention mechanisms for improved response generation. The model was trained on conversational data to facilitate more natural and context-aware interactions.
